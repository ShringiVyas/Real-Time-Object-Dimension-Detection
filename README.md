# Real-Time-Object-Dimension-Detection
This Project aims to detect the possible dimensions of an object in real time.
It uses Canny Edge Detection and technologies like OpenCV and Image Transformation.

Canny Edge Detection:  a technique that identifies edges in an image by reducing noise and preserving important edge features.
